Name: Gabriel Maldonado

How I got into programming? 
    I first learned the power of automated tasks through work and was hooked on understanding how I could learn and apply those tools to my own workflow. Little did I know it was a bit more complicated than just figuring out a few commands and rinse repeat. I tried to do a multitude of different types of training videos, and none of them really got my attention or focussed me enough to get through the work for more than a day or two consistantly. 


What are my goals for programming?
    I look forward to being able to make real some of the ideas I've had in the past that would help me in my day to day or workflow in general. Also using a few projects to incorporate into leading a team and visualizing ideas, as well as explaining my own ideas in a unique way. Ideally I'd like to make a career change and take off with the engineering \ development culture in another company.
